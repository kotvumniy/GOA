      FC Barcelona Declared ‘Technically Bankrupt’ By Leading Catalan Journalist
    </h2>
    <p>
      FC Barcelona have been declared 'technically bankrupt' by a leading
      Catalan journalist. The Blaugrana are mired in debts repeatedly reported
      as exceeding €1 billion ($1.075 billion), and had to pull various
      'economic levers' last summer revolving around the sale of future
      television rights revenue and stakes of their Barca Studios media
      production company so that they could make new signings. Players that
      Barca brought in ahead of 2022/2023, such as Robert Lewandowski, helped
      the Blaugrana lift their first La Liga title in four years and a maiden
      Spanish top flight crown under head coach Xavi Hernandez. A year later,
      however, Barca are again struggling to get their house in order and needed
      to prove to La Liga that they can afford to bring in fresh faces and
      register their contracts through a viability plan. The green light for the
      plan arrived on Tuesday and was too late to stop Lionel Messi joining
      Inter Milan. And even though they now have the thumbs up, Barca still have
      to abide by the 40% rule meaning they can only spend €4 million ($4.3
      million) for every €10 million ($10.7 million) brought in by
      still-required player sales and developments in the need to eliminate €200
      million ($215 million) from the wage bill.
